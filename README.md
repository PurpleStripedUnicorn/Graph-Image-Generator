# Graph Image Generator

This code can generate a graph as an image based on arguments given in the "source.json" file. A formula can be added in parametric style. There are also various options to change the style of the graph

An example of an image is given below:

![Graph Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PurpleStripedUnicorn/Graph-Image-Generator/master/out.png)

Formula for this image:
- x = 0.5 \* cos(t) + 0.7 \* cos(t\*10)
- y = 0.5 \* sin(t) + 0.7 \* sin(t\*10)
